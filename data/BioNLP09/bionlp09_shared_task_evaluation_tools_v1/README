Evaluation software for BioNLP'09 Shared Task on Event Extraction

- version: 1.0
- release: 3 Jun, 2009


This package includes the following files:

readme.txt	This file.
a2-normalize.pl	A perl script for format checking and normalization.
a2-decompose.pl A perl script for event decomposition.
a2-evaluate.pl	A perl script for evaluation.
prepare-gold.pl	A perl script for the preparation of gold data
prepare-eval.pl A perl script for the preparation of evaluation.


[INSTALLATION]

Uncompress all the files in a directory and set $PATH to include it.


[USAGE]

Use 'prepare-gold.pl' to prepare the 'gold' directory for evaluation, e.g.

> prepare-gold.pl bionlp09_shared_task_development_data.tar.gz gold-devel/


Use 'prepare-eval.pl' to prepare evaluation of your predicted files, e.g.

> prepare-eval.pl my_prediction/ my_prediction_eval/


Use 'a2-evalute.pl' to get the evaluation results, e.g.

> a2-evaluate.pl -g gold-devel my_prediction_eval/*.t1
(for evaluation of task 1 in the strict evaluation mode)

> a2-evaluate.pl -g gold-devel -sp my_prediction_eval/*.t12
(for evaluation of task 1 and 2 in the approximate span and recursive mode)

> a2-evaluate.pl -g gold-devel -s my_prediction_eval/*.t1d
(for evaluation of task 1 with event decomposition in the approximate span mode)
